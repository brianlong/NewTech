Developed for new tech colorado. (http://bdnt.org)

The app provides two ways to visualize companies within a state. 
Maximum zoom out summarizes all companies within a state by county and displays them as a hotspot on a map.
Zooming into a hot spot displays a list of companies and their location on a map
Either view can be filtered in real time. Filters include: company found date, category of business, company provided tag, hiring in the next 30 days, investment to date and employee count

Future:
1) ability to register for new tech events (integration with Meetup.com) 2) we plan on syncing company data with the startup genome project
