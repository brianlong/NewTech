New Tech Colorado Website  (http://bdnt.org)
A ruby based web app that uses a map to provide 2 different views of the companies that reside within a state. It was originaly developed for new tech colorado.
The app provides 2 different visualizations based on a users zoom level:
1) maximum zom out summarizes all companies within county and provides filters to update the visualization in real time
    1a) current filters include: company found date, category of business, company provided tags, hiring, investment and employee count
2) 1 levele zoom into a county provides a list of companies in that county
3) Future: ability to register for new tech events
4) Future: we plan on syncing out company database nightly with the startup genome project
